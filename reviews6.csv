Player Name,Technical,Tactical,Effort,Overall,Comments:
Elise Knowles - Midfield(Ouside+ center Mid),6,5,7,6.00,"Needs to practice with her weak foot and improve consistency shooting, tended to have a positive attitude that boosted team morale"
Taylor Curtis - Midfielder(Outside Mid),6,7,8,7.00,"Taylor needs to work on her technical skills. She is a very hard worker, and she finished second on the team in goals. However, she missed many shots as she doesn't tend to square up her body before shooting. Has a strong right foot if she's able to get proper contact"
Margaux Hunt - Striker,10,6,9,8.33,"Incredible player technically, who has a very powerful shot and produces for other athletes. The only player on my team to score more than three goals. Always gives it her all"
Samantha Prouty - Defender,8,7,8,7.67,"Very smart center back, she was the rock of our defense this year, always controlling the back. She and Vivian were the leaders of our team. Great vocal personality as well"
Viv Lee - Goalie,6,7,10,7.67,She's improved by peaks and valleys this year. She played Stars this Spring and learned how to defend different angles and has much better hands than before. We worked with her on leaving the box and not being afraid to make saves coming out of the box. Could be the most impactful player on the team
Zoe Richard - Defense,4,3,6,4.33,"Always gives a great amount of effort. She lacks a weak foot, and she sometimes doesn't understand all formations. Has a bad tendency to poke at the ball"
Emma Follows - Striker,6,9,6,7.00,"Great athlete and a huge contributor to our team. She struggled finishing the ball this season, but she had the speed to dust many defenders and get past them. She needs some work with her left foot, as she rarely chooses to use it"
Megha Nookala - Defense,3,5,4,4.00,"Great locker room presence for the team. She got along with all of her teammates, and she definitely loves to get better. She just is getting used to playing defense and there were some growing pains involved with learning the position and its intricacies"
Sigrid Dahlstrom - CM/OM,8,8,5,7.00,"In my eyes, she was one of the most technically sound players on the team. Her issue is, however, her ""ball hogged ness."" She felt the need to carry the ball too much and she often commited many turnovers. If she gets rid of the ball quicker, she will be an incredible CM. "
Robyn Douglas - Defense,6,8,6,6.67,"Robyn placed a great emphasis on communication. She might not be the mot talented player on the field, but she uplifts other athletes and always seems to be in the right spot at the right time. She's slower for a defender, especially as a center back, but she uses her head well and has a decent(not amazing) first touch. If she's able to improve athletically, I think that she can be a great leader for Bromfield by the time it is her senior season. She also needs to work on using her left foot, for she struggled drilling or trapping with it"
Ashley Faulkner - N/A,0,0,0,0.00,Had ashma issues and thus wasn't able to compete for the team
Grace Buretta,7,6,8,7.00,"Grace was a rock of our team all season long. She put in tons of effort each day, and she even took many of our set pieces and sometimes even corner kicks. Grace is a talented defender and needs to work on her speed a bit to hit the next level"
Beau Rehm - Defense,4,4,6,4.67,"Beau gives a ton of effort, but lacks the technical skills at times overall needed to make the right play. Her passes are often erratic and she's not the faster player on the field, tpyically leading to her getting stuck in transition"
Dylan Kaplan - Striker,5,4,8,5.67,"Very hard worker, but didn't have great finishing abilities. She sometimes ended up drifting too  far back, even when she was a striker. She had a great attitude and was someone other teammates loved being arounmd"
Lainey Irwin,7,6,9,7.33,"A very strong center-back, but we weren't able to play her as much at this position. She performed well at center mid when we had low numbers. She needs to work on her aggressiveness, for she had a bad tendency to foul in our defensive third"
Jane Smith,6,7,8,7.0,Jane needs to work on her technical skills but shows great promise.
Alex Johnson,8,7,8,7.67,Alex demonstrated excellent ball control and consistent effort throughout the season.
Megan Brown,7,6,9,7.33,Megan has a great understanding of the game but needs to work on her tactical awareness.
Chris Evans,9,8,7,8.0,"Chris is a strong all-round player, known for his powerful shots and solid defense."
Katie White,6,7,8,7.0,Katie shows promise in her technical skills but needs to be more aggressive on the field.
